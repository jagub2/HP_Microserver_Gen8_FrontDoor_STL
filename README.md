# HP Microserver Gen8 FrontDoor STL
STL replica of the HP Microserver Gen8 front door. The hook needs to be attached to the base with the same screws you would use for the front panel (3 mm diameter, 7.5 mm width [screw head included]).

You will also need to mount the mounting bolts somehow, I heated them and inserted them into the door base, they are 3mm in diameter.
